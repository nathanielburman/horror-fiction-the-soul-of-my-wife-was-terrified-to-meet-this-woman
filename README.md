# horror-fiction-the-soul-of-my-wife-was-terrified-to-meet-this-woman

# ACT 1

She was a ten. Is a ten the way I remember her and by the way my lover was terrified of her for no reason other than her beauty alone.

and children are killing adults again. the children the children are killing adults, adults, adults, its the adults fault.

The democrats rebel flag was waving in the distance and the Civil War Actors were ready to play re-enactment of the Civil War. The adults all dressed in warrior garbs in greys and blues. Its the adults fault rang in their minds still. Wait its the adults fault? But in my time line, when I first read thee words what it means is something different. We blame it all on the childrens, is , whats, different, about, it. Oh wow. Ha HA!

The time shifts back from some time period between 1920-1980 to now.

# ACT 2
## This woman became the symbol of all women. Ren Faires for life! So anyways, this pale pirate vampire looking ultra hottie walks through a mass of disgusting human filth and I see her floating through with lights and all the special effects. I look at my girl and she sees this being and just freaks. Flips out completely about her feet or somethign and under no way does she want to talk to the beautiful girl.

## Well, I was wanting to talk to her. She was the most beautiful woman there. And as soon as I noticed her I was like, whoah a one, a one one. I found one. You didn't find one, I found it. One.
## It wasn't like that... obcviously. But I found a one she thought was one and I showed her that, but I was looking at her. It doesn't matter anymore, it was a long time ago. And for me to even continue in my rememberance of her image is relly something. She was like milky fleshy with breasts squishy up top and below, but all tall and powerful like a woman, but perfect at a 10 since she hits anyone's eyes. So I never said anything to her at the Ren Faire, because my woman went into a mode man. Girlfriend! She went into a way about her and I didnt get much closer to the Ren Faire Mistress.

# ACT 3
> The Ren Faire is a rip off of the Civil War reenactments they used to do in the 80s-90s.

The Democrats used to dress up and camp out. They loved shooting each other in the fields and eating food out of pots and roasts. They focused on the food man. And, the "technology".

Ren Faires are full of fae. Invisible fae everywhere. There are more invisible people there than visible ones. So when that mysterious 10 popped up it made my wife all wierd.

She really hated the beautiful egirl or cosplay girl. She was really aggressivly hateful about her towards me. It was funny because funny is a word it wasnt. She became less like the 10 and more like a one, but not the one, just a-nother one. One that got away in the end. She squirmed away like a worm, wormy. She was full of lies. We were together for years and years and years. technically I count it like this:

2 years - first together

2 years - school grind

2 years - finishing degree moving

2 years - begining new degrees moving

2 years - finishing new degrees moving

2 years - her starting dr. school program

2 years - break up

Each two years was a sepererate time line. My girlfriend was different from period to period to period. To period? to period? hmmm.

She was cute and sparkly for 6 years maybe. Then the freshman fifteen came, and came, and came again...

That girl at the Ren Faire really got her juices all boiling about something. No other girl there had that effect.

> the Ren Faire Girl was some kind of DARPA setup to rile up my dog wife.

She called herself a dog. One phrase, i could get her to call herself a dog right now.

This other girl... I could get her in kitten mode.

## fiction
So i told my wife everything right there at the faire. and i broke up with my wife at the faire and I ran off with the "girl of my dreams". My dream girls are not 10s, they are 4s or 3s. So i judge her differently. My dream girls are like 2s and 1s. They arent even on the scale yet actually.

Most women I know are 0.7s and they dont even register yet. They still working on themself, working on getting to 1.

# ACT 4
